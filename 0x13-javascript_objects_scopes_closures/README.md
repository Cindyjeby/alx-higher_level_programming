Objects
 - this is a collection of related data and/or functionality.
 - they usually consist of several variables and functions which are called properites and methods when they are inside objects.
 - DotNotation -> used to access a method in an object eg person.name person is the object and name is the object to be accessed
 - BracketNotation -> is an alternative to accessing object properties instead of using the dot notation eg: person["name"];
 - The bracket and dot notation can also be used to change the value of an object eg: if before person.age = 32; to change we just person.age = 45;
or person["name"]["first"] = "cindy" it can be changed the same way person["name"]["first"] = "jeby"
